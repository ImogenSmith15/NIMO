  <h1 class="headings">Coastal Habitats</h1>

    <p>Coastal habitats comprise of those around the shoreline. Coastal habitats are usually distinguished as reaching as far as the coastal shelf. Marine animals found in these kinds of habitats are diverse, from birds such as puffins and penguins, to sea snails and barnacles.</p>
    <p>Mammals found along coastal areas include dolphins.</p>
    <p>Coastal regions also host reptiles such as sea turtles.</p>

  <h2 class="headings">Open Ocean Habitats</h2>

    <p>The open ocean is also known as the pelagic zone. Most marine creatures thrive in shallower depths where light is more abundant.</p>
    <p>Where sea creatures are found in the ocean also depends on the temperature of the water. Creatures found in temperate waters include lobsters, swordfish and sea urchins. Creatures that thrive in tropical waters include seahorses, octopi, clownfish, sharks and stingrays. Polar creatures include killer whales, cod and beluga whales.</p>

  <h3 class="headings">The Deep</h3>

    <p>The Deep Sea is divided into the benthic and demersal zones. The demersal zone is the penultimate layer of the sea column.</p>

    <p>The Benthic zone is at the very bottom of the sea. Organisms who live here need very little light to thrive, and live amongst the sediment or below the sea floor.</p>

    <p>Benthic fish include crabs and clams.

  <h4 class="headings">Estuaries</h4>
