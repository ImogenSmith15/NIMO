          <p>
            Coastal habitats comprise of those around the shoreline, which generally form the most sheltered areas. Coastal habitats are typically distinguished as reaching as far as the coastal shelf. Marine animals found in these kinds of habitats are diverse, from birds such as puffins and penguins, to sea snails and barnacles. The coast is actually comprised of many microhabitats, namely cliffs, rocky shores, sand and shingle beaches, sand dunes, mudflats, saltmarshes and machair.  Mammals found along coastal areas include dolphins, porpoises, seals and sperm whales, whilst rockier areas host seaweed, star fish, crabs and limpets. Coastal regions also play home to reptiles such as sea turtles.

          <h3 class="headings">Open Ocean</h3>
          <p>
            The open ocean is also known as the pelagic zone, and comprises the whole sea column. Most marine creatures thrive in shallower depths where light is more abundant. The upper zone or photic zone is well illuminated, so plants can photosynthesize. Where sea creatures are found in the ocean also depends on the temperature of the water. Creatures found in temperate waters include lobsters, swordfish and sea urchins. Creatures that thrive in tropical waters include seahorses, octopi, clownfish, sharks and stingrays. Polar creatures include killer whales, cod and beluga whales. Despite the enormous size of the open ocean, it does not support a dense population of organisms in its water or on the sea bottom. This is because it is located far from land, which is the main source of nutrients, supporting a larger population. Whilst the population of the open ocean is limited, the diversity of the creatures found here is extensive. As there is less protection in the open ocean, fish have dceveloped defensive tactics such as swimming in schools to confuse predators.

          <p>
            At the very bottom of the sea, on the ocean floor, organisms must be adapted to survive under extreme pressure, limited light, and variable water movement.Organisms have evolved so as not to depend on vision for survival. he overall density of these organisms is quite low and these organisms typically have low metabolic rates. Animals found here include anglerfish, who has a curved appendage that sticks out of the organ at the tip of its "fishing rod," which contans light-producing bacteria, which they use to attract prey. You can also find ghost fish, vampire squid, and giant crustaceans on the sea floor, providing that deep sea dwellers look very different!

          <h4 class="headings">Estuaries</h4>
          <p>
            Estuaries are also a marine habitat, which are classified by their saltwater percentage. Estauries are found where rivers flow into the sea. This includes fjords, lagoons, river mouths, and tidal creeks. An estuary is a dynamic ecosystem having a connection to the open sea through which the sea water enters. The sea water entering the estuary is diluted by the fresh water flowing from rivers and streams. The pattern of dilution varies between different estuaries and depends on the volume of fresh water, the tidal range, and the extent of evaporation of the water in the estuary. This is often a transitory place for wildlife; these environments provide important feeding, spawning and nursery sites for many animals. Certain creatures, such as crabs and some mosquitoes, rely on estuarine water to complete their life cycles and others, such as migratory shore birds, visit estuaries to feed and rest. Estuaries provide habitats for many fish nurseries, depending upon their locations in the world, such as salmon and sea trout. Two of the main challenges of estuarine life are the variability in salinity and sedimentation. Many species of fish and invertebrates have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed osmoconformers and osmoregulators. A large number of animals also burrow to avoid predation and to live in the more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand.
